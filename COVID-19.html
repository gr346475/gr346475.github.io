    <p>A novel coronavirus (CoV) is a new strain of coronavirus that has not
        been previously identified in humans. The new, or “novel” coronavirus,
        now called 2019-nCoV, had not previously detected before the outbreak was
        reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019</p>

        <h3>How does it spread?</h3>
        The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through
        contact with an infected person through respiratory droplets generated
        when a person, for example, coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of
        saliva or discharge from the nose. It is important that everyone practice
        good respiratory hygiene. For example, sneeze or cough into a flexed
        elbow, or use a tissue and discard it immediately into a closed bin.
        It is also very important for people to wash their hands regularly with
        either alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.

                <th>Wash your hands frequently</th>

            <td>Covering your mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing prevent the
                spread of germs and viruses. If you sneeze or cough into your hands,
                you may contaminate objects or people that you touch.</td>
            <td>Hands touch many surfaces which can be contaminated with the virus.
                If you touch your eyes, nose or mouth with your contaminated hands,
                you can transfer the virus from the surface to yourself. </td>
            <td>Handle raw meat, milk or animal organs with care, to avoid
                cross-contamination with uncooked foods, as per good food
                safety practices.</td>
            <td>When someone who is infected with a respiratory disease,
                like 2019-nCoV, coughs or sneezes they project small droplets
                containing the virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the
                virus.</td>
        </table>
        <h3>How dangerous is it?</h3>
        As with other respiratory illnesses, infection with 2019-nCoV can cause mild
        symptoms including a runny nose, sore throat, cough, and fever. It can be
        more severe for some persons and can lead to pneumonia or breathing
        difficulties. More rarely, the disease can be fatal. Older people,
        and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as, diabetes and
        heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with
        the virus.
