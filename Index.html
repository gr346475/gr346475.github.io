        Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness
        ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as

        <p> A coronavirus is one of a number of viruses that cause diseases in
            mammals and birds. In humans, the viruses cause respiratory infections,
            including the common cold, which are typically mild, though rarer forms
            such as SARS, MERS and 2019-nCoV can be lethal. Symptoms vary in other
            species: in chickens, they cause an upper respiratory disease, while in
            cows and pigs coronaviruses cause diarrhea. <b>There are no vaccines
                or antiviral drugs</b>
            to prevent or treat human coronavirus infections.</P>
        <hr>
        <p>We don’t yet know how dangerous the new coronavirus is, and we won’t
            know until more data comes in. The <b>mortality rate is around 2%</b>. However,
            this is likely to be an overestimate since many more people are likely to
            have been infected by the virus but not suffered severe enough symptoms
            to attend hospital, and so have not been counted. For comparison,
            seasonal flu typically has a mortality rate below 1% and is thought
            to cause about <b>400,000 deaths</b> each year globally. <b>Sars had a death
                rate of more than 10%.</b></p>
