    <h3>About Sars</h3>
    SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) – virus identified in 2003. SARS-CoV is
    thought to be an animal virus from an as-yet-uncertain animal reservoir
    , perhaps bats, that spread to other animals (civet cats) and first
    infected humans in the Guangdong province of southern China in 2002.
    </P>

    <p>
        <h3>Transmission</h3>
        An epidemic of SARS affected 26 countries and resulted in more than 8000
        cases in 2003. Since then, a small number of cases have occurred as a
        result of laboratory accidents or, possibly, through animal-to-human
        transmission (Guangdong, China).
        <P>Transmission of SARS-CoV is primarily from person to person. It appears
            to have occurred mainly during the second week of illness, which
            corresponds to the peak of virus excretion in respiratory secretions
            and stool, and when cases with severe disease start to deteriorate
            clinically. Most cases of human-to-human transmission occurred in the
            health care setting, in the absence of adequate infection control
            precautions. Implementation of appropriate infection control practices
            brought the global outbreak to an end.</P>

        <p>
            <h3>Nature of the Disease</h3>
            <p>Symptoms are influenza-like and include fever, malaise, myalgia,
                headache, diarrhoea, and shivering (rigors). No individual symptom or
                cluster of symptoms has proved to be specific for a diagnosis of SARS.
                Although fever is the most frequently reported symptom, it is sometimes
                absent on initial measurement, especially in elderly and immunosuppressed
                patients.</p>
            <p>Cough (initially dry), shortness of breath, and diarrhoea are present
                in the first and/or second week of illness. Severe cases often evolve rapidly,
                progressing to respiratory distress and requiring intensive care.</p>

            <p>
                <h3>Risk for Travellers</h3>
                <p>Currently, no areas of the world are reporting transmission of SARS.
                    Since the end of the global epidemic in July 2003, SARS has reappeared
                    four times – three times from laboratory accidents (Singapore and Chinese
                    Taipei), and once in southern China where the source of infection
                    remains undetermined although there is circumstantial evidence of
                    animal-to-human transmission.</p>

                <p>Travellers should stay informed
                    about current travel recommendations.
                    However, even during the height of the 2003 epidemic,
                    the overall risk of SARS-CoV transmission to travellers was low.</p>
