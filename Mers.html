    <h3>About Mers</h3>
    Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is an illness caused by a
    virus (more specifically, a <a href="index.html">Coronavirus</a> called Middle East Respiratory
    Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Most MERS patients developed severe
    respiratory illness with symptoms of fever, cough and shortness of
    breath. About 3 or 4 out of every 10 patients reported with MERS have died.

        <h3>All cases are linked to the Arabian Peninsula</h3>
        Health officials first reported the disease in Saudi Arabia in
        September 2012. Through retrospective (backward-looking) investigations,
        they later identified that the first known cases of MERS occurred in
        Jordan in April 2012. So far, all cases of MERS have been linked
        through travel to, or residence in, countries in and near the Arabian
        Peninsula. The largest known outbreak of MERS outside the Arabian
        Peninsula occurred in the Republic of Korea in 2015. The outbreak
        was associated with a traveler returning from the Arabian Peninsula.

        <h3>People with MERS can Spread it to Others</h3>
        MERS-CoV has spread from ill people to others through close contact,
        such as caring for or living with an infected person.MERS can affect
        anyone. MERS patients have ranged in age from younger than 1 to 99 years old.
        CDC continues to closely monitor the MERS situation globally. Specialists
        are working with partners to better understand the risks of this virus,
        including the source, how it spreads, and how to prevent infections.
        CDC recognizes the potential for MERS-CoV to spread further and cause
        more cases globally and in the U.S. Doctors have provided information for
        travelers and are working with health departments, hospitals, and
        other partners to prepare for this.
